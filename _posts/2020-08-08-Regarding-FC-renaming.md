title: "Regarding FC renaming"

I wanted to step away from straight up copying a game as famous as FF7 (especially given that we're still in the FF series with 14) to add uniqueness to the FC, so I suggested a name change and asked people what they thought with a poll.

The first poll on FC name change asked if we should keep AVALANCHE or change to Alae Nivis. 6-4 voted FOR change. Although more people voted for changing the name, the people that voted against change seem to feel much more strongly about the issue, so I had decided for now to keep the current name for those four people. But in the end, there was still more votes for change, so should any need arise in the future, I reserve the right to change the name to Alae Nivis «Nivis».

I then held a second poll on a rebranding. The second poll asked if we should keep AVALANCHE or decapitalise to Avalanche. 7-1 voted FOR change. Two of the four people that voted against in the first poll voted for change this time. The other two who voted against last time did not vote in the second poll. When I went to change the name to Avalanche and commit to it, this error came up: <b>That name has been taken.</b>

This was a reminder of just how unique our current name is. Having now played through the remake, I have seen that Avalanche instead of AVALANCHE is used in the remake, so decapitalising isn't actually changing anything.
I still want to change to Alae Nivis. I might put up a third poll with some more name options in the future, or I might decide one day to just go ahead and change it. More people voted for Alae Nivis in the first poll anyway.
