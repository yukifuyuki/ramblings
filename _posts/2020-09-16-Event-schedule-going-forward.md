I'm going to try a new thing for the next few months.

There will be two events per month:
- Treasure hunt on the first Saturday of the month
- Another event sometime on the third weekend of the month (i.e. two weeks after the treasure hunt.) This other series of events will be called FC's Choice Event (FCCE) for the rest of this document.

Both the specific time and content of the FCCE will be voted on. An example of the voting schedule is as follows:

Month 1, 1st weekend:
- Treasure hunt runs.
- Voting for FCCE for Month 1 ends. Voting for Month 2 begins.
- Details for FCCE for Month 1 is published.
- Sign-ups for FCCE for Month 1 begins.

Month 1, 3rd weekend: 
- FCCE for Month 1 runs.

Month 2, 1st weekend:
- Treasure hunt runs.
- Voting for FCCE for Month 2 ends. Voting for Month 3 begins.
- Details for FCCE for Month 2 is published.
- Sign-ups for FCCE for Month 2 begins.

Month 2, 3rd weekend:
- FCCE for Month 2 runs.
- Whether advertisement and sign-up will go for one week or two weeks (two weeks is shown in the example) will be decided on a "see how it goes" basis.

A write-in option will be provided for people to submit event ideas and time outside of the options given. These submissions will be included on the voting form from then onward. The FCCE event is not limited to clearing or farming content, it can be fun events too (e.g. PvP 1v1 dueling tournament, race up Kugane tower, bard performance competition.) The FC currently has over 200 million gil in cash that is sitting there unused. I am happy for some of it to go to event rewards.

To control the number of options in each vote the least popular option may or may not be removed from future votes. It can be added back in from a write-in option later.

A current vote is underway for 26/27 September. Votes in the future will be very similar to this one. The current vote can be found at:
