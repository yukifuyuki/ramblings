There has been a poll up for the past two or three days to gauge opinions on how FC events should be run. I thank everyone for the many and speedy responses.
The opinion is divided almost 50/50 on whether we should have weekly events or fortnightly events. I have made the decision to have weekly events. People who do not wish to, or are unable to, attend events weekly can simply not go. In fact, I do not expect anyone to attend every single week. Just come for the ones you are interested in. We have been blessed with a high number of active players recently thanks to the efforts of several volunteer recruiters, so low turnouts should no longer be a problem. By the same token, I will not be attending multiple events if I am unable to/have no interest in. For this reason, I will be expecting people to rise up to the occasion and help lead these events. 

Events will alternative between Treasure Hunt and some other event every week. This means there will be Treasure Hunts every 2 weeks, and some other content on the other weeks. Treasure Hunts will still be at the same time as before, 11:00 am GMT on Saturday.
The first content weekend of each month will be voted on by the FC, this limits the number of times people need to vote to once per month. The remaining Saturdays I will pick whatever I want to do.
Over the past two days, I have made extensive changes to the Discord bot to automate much of these kinds of processes. As the events are going through much faster now, while I will still keep this website updated, I will not be making fancy formatting edits to the schedule, merely copying and pasting over the schedule from Discord with only minor formatting changes for readability.

During my overhaul of the Discord bot, I have also added the ability for anyone in the FC to stream to the newly created FC Twitch channel at <https://www.twitch.tv/AVAL_tv>
Opinions on the recent poll showed that many people were interested in watching, with a few people interested in streaming. All the systems are set up now, and it should require very little input from me other than if changes need to be made to the setup. I will be leaving this mostly up to people who are interested in it. That being said, I will still be personally streaming the FC events that I attend and maybe some other gameplay.
If you are interested in streaming to the FC channel, have a look at <https://yukifuyuki.github.io/avalanche/aval_tv>
If you would like to have some features added to the Discord bot, please let me know and I will consider it.
As always, if you encounter some problem with the FC or the game, or have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
