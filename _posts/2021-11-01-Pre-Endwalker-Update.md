We are soon coming up to the release of Endwalker, and I would like to detail FC activities over this transitional phase.

# As Goes Shadowbringers, So Goes AVALANCHE
As many of you have seen, I put up a vote on 1 October regarding renaming the FC. The results were in favour of renaming the FC to Alae Nivis, as they did in August 2020. This time I have decided to go ahead with the name change. I will be making the change on Saturday 13 November, after the FC event. We will have the last FC event in Shadowbringers as AVALANCHE and head into Endwalker as Alae Nivis. I invite everyone to come design the new FC logo together.

# FC event schedule surrounding Endwalker release
A custom event schedule will replace the regular FC schedule for one month or so following the release of Endwalker. This custom schedule will likely see us running normal level raids on the day of its release, and extreme trials on Saturday after their release. Note that this also means we will not be running weekly events during this time.
